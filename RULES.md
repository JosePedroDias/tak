- focusing of 5x5 variant -

2 player game

types of pieces:
- stones (21 per player) - can be set flat or standing
- capstone (1 per player)

after an initial round where opposing players place 1 piece of the opponent,
players play in turns

a player must either PLACE a new piece or MOVE a stack they control
(controlling a stack means the topmost piece is yours. a player can only move at most
displace the topmost 5 pieces in the stack they control)

PLACing a piece can only happen on empty cells

for MOVing a stack, the player must choose a direction and distribute the amount of topmost pieces (1-5)
from it in consecutive cells in the chosen direction, as long as
- no cell is left empty along the way
- destination cells are not capstones
- destination cells can only have standing stones IF a capstone lands there, flattening it

the main objective of the game is to create a ROAD connecting 2 opposing sides of the board
(horizontal or vertical). a road is made of continuous orthogonal cells having the topmost occupant be
a FLAT stone or CAPSTONE of our color. diagonals don't count and STANDING stones break roads

the game ends if:
- a road if successfully created (win). creating roads for both players count as a win for whoever played just the same
- all cells get filled (points given to the amount of non-STANDING pieces in the topmost cells)

one can say TAK when they're one move away from creating a road (works like CHECK in chess)
