- focusing of 5x5 variant first -

2 player game

types of pieces:
- stones (21 per player) - can be set flat or standing
- capstone (1 per player)

After an initial round where both players choose the placement of one piece of their opponent, players play in turns handling their own pieces.

A player must either PLACE a new piece or MOVE a stack they control
(controlling a stack means the topmost piece is yours.
A player can only move at most displace the topmost 5 pieces in the stack they control)* .

PLACing a piece can only happen on empty cells!

For MOVing a stack, the player must choose a direction and distribute the amount of topmost pieces (1-5)*
from it in consecutive cells in the chosen direction, as long as
- no cell is left empty along the way;
- destination cells are not capstones;
- destination cells can only have standing stones IF a capstone lands there, flattening it.

The main objective of the game is to create a ROAD connecting 2 opposing sides of the board (horizontal or vertical).
A road is made of continuous orthogonal cells having the topmost occupant be
a FLAT stone or CAPSTONE of our color. Diagonals don't count and STANDING stones break roads.

The game ends if:
- a road if successfully created (win). Accidentally creating roads for both players count as a win to whoever played just the same;
- all cells get filled (with points given to the amount of non-STANDING pieces in the topmost cells).

One can say TAK when they're one move away from creating a road (works like CHECK in chess).

TINUÃ‹ is a non-defendable TAK, akin to check mate - your opponent is about to create a road and you can't avoid it.

Scoring TODO
